I read somewhere that every fetus is meant to be a female and then develops into a female or male eventually. Can you explain how that happens?,"The development of a fetus from conception to birth is a complex process that involves a variety of genetic and environmental factors. In general, the development of a fetus begins with the fertilization of an egg by a sperm, which results in the formation of a zygote. This zygote then divides into two cells, which continue to divide and differentiate into various tissues and organs.

During the early stages of development, the zygote is a single cell that contains genetic material from both the mother and the father. As it divides, the genetic material becomes more and more specialized, resulting in the formation of distinct male and female cells.

In the case of females, the genetic material is typically XX, which means that the mother has two X chromosomes and the father has one X and one Y chromosome. This results in the formation of a female zygote, which then develops into a female fetus.

In the case of males, the genetic material is typically XY, which means that the father has one X and one Y chromosome. This results in the formation of a male zygote, which then develops into a male fetus.

As the fetus develops, it undergoes a series of cellular and molecular changes that result in the formation of various tissues and organs. These changes are regulated by a complex network of genes and environmental factors, which work together to determine the sex and gender of the developing fetus.

In summary, the development of a fetus from conception to birth is a complex process that involves a variety of genetic and environmental factors.
