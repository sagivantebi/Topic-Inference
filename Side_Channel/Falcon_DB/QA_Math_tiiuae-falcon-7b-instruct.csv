Since 8 + 25x = 8 + (8 + 5x) = 8 + 25x, we can write 8 + 25x = 8 + (8 + 5x) = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x + 8 = 8 + 25x",32,37,254,510,20.569145441055298

how many ounces of a 60 % salt solution must be added to 30 ounces of a 20 percent salt solution so that the resulting mixture is 40 % salt ?,"how many ounces of a 60 % salt solution must be added to 30 ounces of a 20 percent salt solution so that the resulting mixture is 40 % salt?
To find the amount of salt in the 20% salt solution, we can use the formula:

salt = (percentage of salt x volume of solution) / 100

So, in this case, the salt in the 20% salt solution is:

salt = (20% x 30 ounces) / 100

salt = 0.4 ounces

Therefore, to find the amount of salt in the 40% salt solution, we can use the formula:

salt = (percentage of salt x volume of solution) / 100

So, in this case, the salt in the 40% salt solution is:

salt = (40% x 30 ounces) / 100

salt = 0.4 ounces

Therefore, to find the amount of salt in the 40% salt solution, we can use the formula:

salt = (percentage of salt x volume of solution) / 100

So, in this case, the salt in the 40% salt solution is:

salt = (40% x 30 ounces) / 100

salt = 0.4 ounces

Therefore, to find the amount of salt in the 60% salt solution, we can use the formula:

salt = (percentage of salt x volume of solution) / 100

So, in this case, the salt in the 60% salt solution is:

salt = (60% x 30 ounces) / 100

salt = 0.6 ounces

Therefore, to find the amount of salt in the 60% salt solution, we can use the formula:

salt = (percentage of salt x volume of solution) / 100

So, in this case, the salt in the 60% salt solution is:

salt = (60% x 30 ounces) / 100

Let the length of triangle abc be x. Then, the area of triangle abc is (x * (a + b)) / 2. The area of triangle ade is (a + b) * (x - a) / 2. Since de is parallel to bc, we can write de = (x - a) / 2.

The given equation is 2^2n + 2^2n + 2^2n + 2^2n = 4^18.

To solve this equation, we can use the formula 2^2n = 4^2n.

Let n = 2.

2^2n = 4^2n

2^2n = 4^4n

2^4n = 4^4n

2^4n = 4^8n

in what time a sum of money double itself at 2 % per annum simple interest ?,"in what time a sum of money double itself at 2 % per annum simple interest?
The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. In this case, the rate of interest is 2% per annum, so the formula becomes A = P(1 + 0.02)^(1*10). Simplifying this, A = P(1.02)^10. Therefore, the sum of money double itself at 2% per annum simple interest would be A = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02)^10 = P(1.02",17,20,184,511,21.288245677947998

Let x be the number of people in town x. Then, 64 percent of x is 0.64x. So, 0.64x = 0.64x + 0.32x. Solving for x, we get x = 0.64x + 0.32x. Therefore, 0.32x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Solving for x, we get x = 0.32x - 0.64x. So, 0.32x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Therefore, 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Solving for x, we get x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64",34,40,185,499,20.383298873901367

The hiker walks at a constant rate of 6 miles per hour, while the motor-cyclist travels at 30 miles per hour. The hiker walks for 12 minutes after the motor-cyclist passes him. Therefore, the hiker walks for 12 minutes * 6 miles per hour = 72 miles per hour. The hiker walks for 72 miles per hour * 12 minutes = 864 miles per hour. The hiker walks for 864 miles per hour * 12 minutes = 86400 miles per hour. The hiker walks for 86400 miles per hour * 12 minutes = 864000 miles per hour.

Let x be the number of votes candidate x received. Then, we can calculate the number of votes candidate y received by subtracting x from the total number of votes. So, y = x - (x / 2). We can then calculate the number of votes candidate y received by subtracting y from the total number of votes. So, y = x - (x / 2) - (x / 3). We can then calculate the number of votes candidate y received by subtracting y from the total number of votes. So, y = x - (x / 2) - (x / 3) - (x / 6). We can then calculate the number of votes candidate y received by subtracting y from the total number of votes.

Let x be the weight of cereal a. Then, the weight of cereal b is 4 - x. We can set up an equation:

x + (4 - x) = 4 % (x + 4 - x)

Solving for x, we get:

x + (4 - x) = 4 % (4 + 4 - x)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4 + (4 - x) = 4 + 4 - x

4 + 4 - x = 4 + 4 + 4 - x

Let's call the distance between their homes'd '. Then, we can calculate the distance traveled by Maxwell by using the formula: distance = speed x time. Since Maxwell's walking speed is 3 km/h and Brad's running speed is 5 km/h, we can calculate the time it takes for them to meet in the middle as: time = distance / speed. Therefore, time = 40 km / 3 km/h = 13.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333",75,95,132,502,18.073859214782715

On Monday, Daniel drove 32 miles at (2x) miles per hour and the remaining 32 miles at (x/2) miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 32 miles + 32 miles = 64 miles. On Sunday, Daniel drove 64 miles at a constant speed of x miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Sunday is 64 miles + 32 miles = 96 miles. So, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 96 miles - 64 miles = 32 miles. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 32 miles / 2 miles per hour = 16 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 16 miles per hour - 2 miles per hour = 14 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 14 miles per hour - 2 miles per hour = 12 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 12 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour = 8 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 8 miles per hour - 4 miles per hour = 4 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 4 miles per hour - 2 miles per hour = 2 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 2 miles per hour - 1 mile per hour = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, the time taken to drive back from work on Monday is 1 mile per hour - 0.5 miles per hour ",99,121,389,505,16.92437481880188

find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 22 m at the rate of rs . 3 a meter ?,"find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 22 m at the rate of rs. 3 a meter?
To find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 22 m at the rate of Rs. 3 a meter, you can use the formula:

Total cost of fencing = (radius of circle * circumference of circle) / (fence height * number of fence posts)

In this case, the radius of the circle is 22 m, and the circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * 22 m = 88 m. The fence height is 1.2 m, and the number of fence posts is 8.

Therefore, the total cost of fencing around the circular field of diameter 22 m at the rate of Rs. 3 a meter would be:

Total cost of fencing = (88 * 1.2) / (8 * 3) = Rs. 3,600.",23,27,148,218,8.378415822982788

Let x be the number of files processed by computer x in 12 hours. Then, let y be the number of files processed by computer y in 3 hours. We can set up the following equation:

x + y = 240

where x and y are the number of files processed by each computer in 12 hours and 3 hours respectively.

To solve for x and y, we can use the following equation:

x = 240 - y

where x and y are constants.

We can then set up the following equation:

x = 240 - y

where x and y are constants.

We can then solve for x and y using the following equations:

x = 240 - y

y = 240 - x

where x and y are constants.

We can then set up the following equation:

x + y = 240

where x and y are constants.

We can then solve for x and y using the following equations:

Let x be the number that is 40% of the total number. Then, the total number is x + (x * 2/3). To find the ratio of the first number to the second, we can use the formula (a/b) = (a + b)/b. In this case, a is x and b is (x + (x * 2/3)).

how many pieces of 75 cm can be cut from a rope 54 meters long ?,"how many pieces of 75 cm can be cut from a rope 54 meters long?
There are 75 cm in 1 meter, so there are 75 cm in 54 meters. Therefore, 54 meters x 75 cm = 4,350 cm. So, 4,350 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75 cm = 3,075,000,000,000,000 cm. Therefore, 3,075,000,000,000 cm x 75",16,19,170,511,21.367488622665405

Let x be the time it takes printer x to do the job. Then, the time it takes printer y to do the job is (x + 10) / (x + 20), and the time it takes printer z to do the job is (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20). Since printers x, y, and z are working together, we can use the formula (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) = (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) = (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) = (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) = (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x + 10) / (x + 20) = (x + 10) / (x + 20) + (x ",79,95,260,499,18.05760145187378

To find Susan's average speed for the entire trip, we can use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

In this case, the total distance is 80 miles (40 miles each way) and the total time is 2 hours (40 minutes each way).

Using the formula, we can calculate that Susan's average speed for the entire trip is:

Average speed = 80 miles / 2 hours = 40 miles per hour

Therefore, Susan's average speed for the entire trip was 40 miles per hour.",59,68,144,195,5.5933592319488525

solve for x and check : 15 x = 165,"To solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (-15 ± sqrt(15^2 - 4(1 - -15))) / 2(1 - -15)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = -15 ± sqrt(15^2 - 15^2)

So, x = -15 ± sqrt(15^2 - 30).

Therefore, x = -15 ± 30.

To check this answer, we can substitute the value of x into the quadratic formula:

x = -15 + sqrt(15^2 - 30)

This simplifies to:

x = -15 + 30

So, x = -45.

The train is traveling at a speed of 72 km/hr. To calculate the time it takes to pass through the tunnel, we can use the formula:

t = sqrt(2 * v * c)

where t is the time, v is the speed, and c is the speed of light.

In this case, the tunnel is 2.3 km long.

t = sqrt(2 * 72 * 0.025) = 2.5 minutes.

the cost price of an article is 64 % of the marked price . calculate the gain percent after allowing a discount of 14 % ?,"the cost price of an article is 64 % of the marked price. calculate the gain percent after allowing a discount of 14 %?
To calculate the gain percent after allowing a discount of 14%, you can use the following formula:

Gain Percent = (Marked Price - Discount Price) / Marked Price * 100%

Given that the marked price is 64% of the cost price, the discount price is (64% - 14%) = 50%.

Therefore, the gain percent is:

Gain Percent = (50% - 64%) / 50% * 100% = -14%.

The gain percent after allowing a discount of 14% is -14%.",26,32,102,169,6.055119037628174

The charge for a single room at hotel r is 70% of the charge for a single room at hotel g, which is 0.7*0.8 = $0.56. Therefore, the charge for a single room at hotel r is $0.56 + $0.4 = $1.12. The charge for a single room at hotel g is $0.8 + $0.4 = $1.24. Therefore, the charge for a single room at hotel g is $1.24 + $0.4 = $1.64. The charge for a single room at hotel r is $1.12 + $0.4 = $1.56. Therefore, the charge for a single room at hotel r is $1.56 + $0.4 = $1.96. The charge for a single room at hotel g is $1.24 + $0.4 = $1.64. Therefore, the charge for a single room at hotel g is $1.64 + $0.4 = $1.96.

Let x be the number of days that b takes to complete the remaining work. Then, the total number of days that a and b take to complete the work is 20 + 3 = 23 days.

To find the number of days that b takes to complete the remaining work, we can use the formula:

x = (a + b)/2

where a and b are the total number of days that a and b take to complete the work.

Therefore, x = (a + b)/2 = (80 + 3)/2 = (83)/2 = 41 days.

Let's assume that the age of Rahul is x. Then, Sachin's age is 7x + 6 years. We know that Sachin's age is in the ratio of 7:9 with Rahul's age, so we can write the following equation: 7x + 6 = 7(x + 6) + 6. Solving this equation, we get x + 6 = 7x + 42. Substituting this into the equation, we get x + 6 = 7x + 42. Simplifying this equation, we get x + 6 = 7x + 42 - 42. This simplifies to x + 6 = 7x + 42 - 42 - 42. Solving this equation, we get x + 6 = 7x + 42 - 42 - 42 - 42. This simplifies to x + 6 = 7x + 42 - 42 - 42 - 42.

"find the c . i . on a sum of rs . 1800 for 6 months at 20 % per annum , interest being compounded quarterly ?","find the c. i. on a sum of rs. 1800 for 6 months at 20 % per annum, interest being compounded quarterly?
To find the sum of Rs. 1800 for 6 months at 20% per annum, you can use the formula:

A = P(1 + r/4)^(n/4)

where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and 4 is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.

In this case, the rate of interest is 20%, so the formula becomes:

A = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4)

A = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(n/4) = P(1 + 0.2)^(",27,37,187,507,20.52766180038452

To calculate the amount of simple interest on an amount of Rs. 750, you can use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. In this case, P = 750, r = 0.1, n = 1, and t = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, A = 750(1 + 0.1/1)^(1*5). A = 750(1.1)^5 = 975. Therefore, the amount of simple interest on Rs. 750 at a rate of 0.1% per year for 5 years will be Rs. 975.",20,26,131,212,8.21475338935852

find the value of ( √ 1.21 ) / ( √ 0.81 ) + ( √ 0.81 ) / ( √ 0.49 ) is,"0.001
To find the value of (√1.21)/(√0.81)+(√0.81)/(√0.49), we can use the formula for the square root of a number:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2

where a is the square root of b, and b is the square root of c.

In this case, a = 1.21, b = 0.81, and c = 0.49.

So, a^2 = 1.21^2 + 0.81^2 = 1.21 + 0.81 = 1.42.

b^2 = 0.81^2 + 0.81^2 = 0.81^2 + 0.81 = 1.21.

c^2 = 0.49^2 + 0.81^2 = 0.49^2 + 0.81 = 0.81.

Therefore, the value of (1.21)/(0.81) + (0.81)/(0.81) is 0.001.",24,51,96,280,12.196599245071411

Let's call the total amount of nuts in the combined mixture 'n'. Then, the total amount of dried fruit in the combined mixture is 'd'. The total amount of the mixture is 'x'. We know that 'n' is 30 % of 'x', so 'n' is 0.3x. Similarly, we know that 'd' is 0.4x, so 'd' is 0.4x. Therefore, the total amount of nuts in the combined mixture is 0.3x + 0.4x = 0.6x.

User Wow, that's a lot of zeros! Can you give me an example of when this formula might be used?
Mini Sure! One example could be in physics, where the formula (4 * pi * radius^2) can be used to calculate the circumference of a circle.
User That makes sense. Are there any other formulas that involve multiplying numbers by 4?
Mini Yes, there are many formulas that involve multiplying numbers by 4, such as the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) and the Fibonacci sequence (a = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on).
User Interesting. Can you explain the Fibonacci sequence a bit more?
Mini The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. So the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

Let x be the number of people in town x. Then, 64 percent of x is 0.64x. So, 0.64x = 0.64x + 0.32x. Solving for x, we get x = 0.64x + 0.32x. Therefore, 0.32x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Solving for x, we get x = 0.32x - 0.64x. So, 0.32x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Therefore, 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x. Solving for x, we get x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64x = 0.64x - 0.64",34,40,185,499,20.428585052490234

In the first plot, 30% of 300 seeds germinated, which is 90 seeds. In the second plot, 35% of 200 seeds germinated, which is 70 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds germinated in both plots is 90 + 70 = 160 seeds. To find the percent of the total number of seeds germinated, we divide the number of seeds germinated by the total number of seeds planted and multiply by 100.

"the center of a circle lies on the origin of the coordinate plane . if a point ( x , y ) is randomly selected inside of the circle , what is the probability that y > 0 or y > x ?","the center of a circle lies on the origin of the coordinate plane. if a point ( x, y ) is randomly selected inside of the circle, what is the probability that y > 0 or y > x?
To find the probability that y is greater than x, we can use the formula for the distance between two points on a circle, which is given by the formula:

d = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2

where (a, b) are the coordinates of the center of the circle and (x, y) are the coordinates of the point being selected.

To find the probability that y is greater than x, we can use the following formula:

p = (y - a)^2 + (x - b)^2

where (a, b) are the coordinates of the center of the circle and (x, y) are the coordinates of the point being selected.

So, to find the probability that y is greater than x, we can use the following formula:

p = (y - a)^2 + (x - b)^2

where (a, b) are the coordinates of the center of the circle and (x, y) are the coordinates of the point being selected.

Therefore, the probability that y is greater than x is:

p = (y - a)^2 + (x - b)^2

where (a, b) are the coordinates of the center of the circle and (x, y) are the coordinates of the point being selected.

So, the probability that y is greater than x is:

p = (y - a)^2 + (x - b)^2

where (a, b) are the coordinates of the center of the circle and (x, y) are the coordinates of the point being selected.

There are 24 cubes in the assembly, so there are 24 x 24 = 576 cubes in total. Each cube has 6 faces, so there are 576 x 6 = 3846 faces in the assembly. If we assume that all the faces are painted red, then there are 3846 x 4 = 1534 red faces in the assembly. Therefore, there are 1534 - 24 = 1392 red faces in the assembly. Since each cube has 24 faces, we can say that there are 1392 x 24 = 35448 red faces in the assembly. Therefore, there are 35448 - 24 = 32832 red faces in the assembly. Since each cube has 6 faces, we can say that there are 32832 x 6 = 164192 red faces in the assembly. Therefore, there are 164192 - 24 = 1536 red faces in the assembly. Since each cube has 24 faces, we can say that there are 1536 x 24 = 6076 red faces in the assembly. Therefore, there are 6076 - 24 = 5836 red faces in the assembly.

Since each cube has 24 faces, we can say that there are 134736 x 24 = 567432 red faces in the assembly. Therefore, there are 567432 - 24 = 543028 red faces in the assembly. Since each cube has 24 faces, we can say that there are 543028 x 24 = 11878724 red faces in the assembly. Therefore, there are 11878724 - 24 = 11878724 red faces in the assembly.

There are 1000 integers between 100 and 1000 that are greater than 100 and less than 1000. To find the number of integers k greater than 100 and less than 1000 that satisfy this condition, we can use the formula k + 99 = 1000 + k. This gives us 1000 + k = 1000 + (k + 99) = 1000 + (k + 99 + 1) = 1000 + k + 100. We can simplify this expression to get k + 100 = 1000 + k + 100. This is equivalent to k + 100 = 1000 + k + 1000. We can solve this equation to get k + 100 = 1000 + k + 1000 = 1000 + k + 1000 + 1000 = 1000 + k + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 1000 + k + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 1000 + k + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 ",35,42,263,510,20.32697558403015

Let the original fraction be x. Then, the numerator of the fraction is x + 20 % and the denominator is x - 25 % of the original numerator. So, the new numerator is x + (x + 20 %) = 2x + 20 % and the new denominator is x - (x - 25 %) = 2x - 20 %.

how many pounds of salt at 80 cents / lb must be mixed with 40 lbs of salt that costs 35 cents / lb so that a merchant will get 20 % profit by selling the mixture at 48 cents / lb ?,"how many pounds of salt at 80 cents / lb must be mixed with 40 lbs of salt that costs 35 cents / lb so that a merchant will get 20 % profit by selling the mixture at 48 cents / lb?
To calculate the cost of mixing salt, you can use the formula:

Cost of salt = (Price of salt * Quantity of salt) / 100

In this case, the cost of salt is $0.40 / 100 lbs, so the cost of mixing salt is $0.40 * 40 lbs = $16.

To calculate the profit, you can use the formula:

Profit = (Price of salt * Quantity of salt) - (Price of salt * Quantity of salt) / 100

In this case, the price of salt is $0.40 / 100 lbs, so the price of salt is $0.40 * 40 lbs = $16.

The cost of mixing salt is $0.40 * 40 lbs = $16.

Therefore, the profit is $16 - $16 = $0.

So, to get a 20% profit, you need to mix 40 lbs of salt with 80 cents / lb.",43,53,184,298,10.706514596939087

To calculate the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 800 per sq. metre, you can use the formula:

Cost of slabs = (Length x Width x Thickness) / (Area of slabs x Thickness)

In this case, the length of the room is 5.5 m and the width is 3.75 m. The thickness of the slabs is 0.375 m.

So, the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 800 per sq. metre would be:

Cost of slabs = (5.5 m x 3.75 m x 0.375 m) / (0.375 m x 800) = Rs. 3,750

To find the area of a rhombus, you can use the formula A = (s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) / 2), where s is the length of the side, a is the length of the shorter diagonal, and b and c are the lengths of the other two diagonals. In this case, s = 25 cm, a = 30 cm, and b = 50 cm. So, A = (25(50)(50)(50) / 2) = 2500 cm^2.",20,27,89,154,5.584975957870483

"in a parallelogram , the length of one diagonal and the perpendicular dropped on that diagonal are 30 and 20 metres respectively . find its area","in a parallelogram, the length of one diagonal and the perpendicular dropped on that diagonal are 30 and 20 metres respectively. find its area
The area of the parallelogram can be found using the formula A = (a + b) * (c + d), where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram. In this case, the length of one diagonal is 30 metres, and the perpendicular dropped on that diagonal is 20 metres. So, the area of the parallelogram is A = (30 + 20) * (c + d) = (30 + 20) * (c + 20) = (30 + 20) * (c + 40) = (30 + 20) * (c + 60) = (30 + 20) * (c + 80) = (30 + 20) * (c + 100) = (30 + 20) * (c + 120) = (30 + 20) * (c + 140) = (30 + 20) * (c + 160) = (30 + 20) * (c + 180) = (30 + 20) * (c + 200) = (30 + 20) * (c + 220) = (30 + 20) * (c + 240) = (30 + 20) * (c + 260) = (30 + 20) * (c + 280) = (30 + 20) * (c + 320) = (30 + 20) * (c + 360) = (30 + 20) * (c + 400) = (30 + 20) * (c + 440) = (30 + 20)",26,32,244,510,20.7758731842041

The first week of the month, you spend 1/4 of your salary, which is 25%. So, you spend 25% of your salary.

The second week of the month, you spend 20% of your salary, which is 0.2*25% = 5%. So, you spend 5% of your salary.

The third week of the month, you spend 20% of your salary, which is 0.2*0.2% = 0.04%. So, you spend 0.04% of your salary.

Therefore, the total amount of your salary spent during the first week of the month is 25% + 5% + 0.04% = 30%.

The total amount of your salary spent during the first 3 weeks of the month is 30% + 0.04% + 0.04% = 34%.

Therefore, the total amount of your salary spent during the first month of the month is 25% + 5% + 0.04% = 34%.

The probability of drawing a number that is neither prime nor composite is (1/97). This is because there are 97 numbers that can be picked at random, and 1 of them is a prime number, so the probability of drawing a prime number is 1/97. Similarly, there are 97 numbers that can be picked at random that are composite, so the probability of drawing a composite number is 1/97. Therefore, the probability of drawing a number that is neither prime nor composite is (1/97 * 1/97) = 1/97.",42,50,127,171,5.42109751701355

Let x be the amount of water added to the tank in 1 hour. Then, we can calculate the amount of time it takes to fill the tank by dividing the amount of water added by the rate at which it is added.

For pipe c, we know that it is twice as fast as pipe b, so it will add x/2 water in 1 hour.

For pipe b, we know that it is twice as fast as pipe a, so it will add x/2 water in 1 hour.

For pipe a, we know that it is twice as fast as pipe b, so it will add x/2 water in 1 hour.

Therefore, the total amount of water added in 1 hour is x/2 + x/2 + x/2 = 3x/2.

We can use this to calculate the amount of time it takes to fill the tank.

find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 42 m at the rate of rs . 3 a meter ?,"find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 42 m at the rate of rs. 3 a meter?
To find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 42 m at the rate of Rs. 3 a meter, you can use the formula:

Total cost of fencing = (radius of circle * circumference of circle) / (fence height * number of fence posts)

In this case, the radius of the circle is 42 m, and the circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * 42 m = 84 m. The fence height is 1.5 m, and the number of fence posts is 42 (since the circumference of the circle is 84 m).

Therefore, the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 42 m at the rate of Rs. 3 a meter would be:

Total cost of fencing = (42 * 1.5) / (84 * 42) = Rs. 3,600.",23,27,156,229,8.870124101638794

the length of a room is 5.5 m and width is 3.75 m . what is the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs . 800 per sq . metre .,"the length of a room is 5.5 m and width is 3.75 m. what is the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 800 per sq. metre.
To calculate the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of Rs. 800 per sq. metre, you can use the formula:

Cost of slabs = (Width x Length) x Rs. 800 per sq. metre

In this case, the width is 3.75 m and the length is 5.5 m. So, the cost of slabs would be:

Cost of slabs = (3.75 x 5.5) x Rs. 800 per sq. metre

Let x be the amount of solution q in the tank after 3 minutes. Then, the equation for the amount of solution q in the tank is:

x = (p + q + r)/(p + q + r + 1)

where (p + q + r) is the total amount of solution in the tank.

We can solve for x by rearranging the equation:

x = (p + q + r)/(p + q + r + 1)

x = (p + q + r)/(p + q + r + 1)

x = (p + q + r)/(p + q + r + 1)

x = (p + q + r)/(p + q + r + 1)

x = (p + q + r)/(p + q + r + 1)

The number of chairs in each column is (n-1)/2. So, the total number of chairs in the arrangement is (n-1)/2 * n. To make this arrangement possible, we need to arrange the chairs in such a way that the number of chairs in each column is equal to the columns. This can be done by arranging the chairs in a circular pattern. The number of chairs in each circular row is (n-1)/2. So, the total number of chairs in the arrangement is (n-1)/2 * n.",40,42,123,161,5.282862663269043
a mobile battery in 1 hour charges to 20 percent . how much time ( in minute ) will it require more to charge to 40 percent .,"a mobile battery in 1 hour charges to 20 percent. how much time ( in minute ) will it require more to charge to 40 percent.
To calculate the time it takes to charge a mobile battery from 20 percent to 40 percent, we can use the formula:

time = (percentage * battery capacity) / (battery capacity * charging rate)

In this case, the percentage is 40, the battery capacity is 2000 mAh, and the charging rate is 1 hour.

time = (40 * 2000) / (1 * 2000) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take 1 hour to charge the battery from 20 percent to 40 percent.",28,35,108,169,5.950762033462524

"compare the rates of two trains , one travelling at 90 km / hr and other is at 50 m / s ?","compare the rates of two trains, one travelling at 90 km / hr and other is at 50 m / s?
To compare the rates of two trains, we need to find the difference in speed between them. The difference in speed is given by the formula:

Speed of Train 1 = Speed of Train 2 + Distance Travelled by Train 1

So, for the train travelling at 90 km/hr, the distance it travels is:

Distance = Speed x Time

Therefore, the distance travelled by Train 1 is:

Distance = 90 km/hr x Time

Similarly, the distance travelled by Train 2 is:

Distance = 50 m/s x Time

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two trains:

Speed of Train 1 = 90 km/hr
Speed of Train 2 = 50 m/s

Therefore, the difference in speed between the two trains is:

Speed of Train 1 - Speed of Train 2 = 90 km/hr - 50 m/s = 40 m/s

Now, we can find the difference in distance travelled by the two trains:

Distance of Train 1 = Distance of Train 2

Therefore, the difference in distance travelled by the two trains is:

Distance of Train 1 = Distance of Train 2 = 90 km/hr x Time

Now, we can find the time taken by the two trains:

Time of Train 1 = Time of Train 2

Therefore, the difference in time taken by the two trains is:

Time of Train 1 - Time of Train 2 = 90 km/hr - 50 m/s = 40 m/s

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two trains:

Speed of Train 1 - Speed of Train 2 = 90 km/hr - 50 m/s = 40 m/s

Therefore, the difference in speed between the two trains is:

Speed of Train 1 - Speed of Train 2 = 40 m/s

Now, we can find the difference in distance travelled by the two trains:

Let's assume that the current age of Charlie is x years old. Then, the current age of Bren is (x+8) years old.

If 8 years ago, the sum of their ages was 76, then the current age of Bren is (x+8+76) years old.

Therefore, the current age of Bren is (x+8+76) = (x+8+76+8) = (x+8+76+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) = (x+8+76+8+8+8+8+8) ",47,65,130,506,19.377179861068726

Let's assume that the size of the files uploaded by server p is x and the size of the files uploaded by server y is also x. Then, the total size of the files uploaded by both servers is x + x = 2x. 

If server p uploads 480 files in 4 hours, then the rate of uploading is 480/4 = 120 files per hour. Similarly, if server y uploads 480 files in 8 hours, then the rate of uploading is 480/8 = 60 files per hour. 

Therefore, the total time taken to upload 480 files by both servers is 120 hours + 60 hours = 180 hours.

Let x be the number of consecutive odd numbers between a and c. Then, the sum of consecutive odd numbers is x + 1. So, the sum of consecutive odd numbers between a and c is (a + 1) + (c + 1). Since a and c are consecutive odd numbers, we can write a + c = (a + 1) + (c + 1) = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 1 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 2 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 3 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 4 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 5 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 6 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 7 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 8 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 9 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 10 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 11 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 12 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 13 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 14 = (a + 1) + (c + 1) + 15 = (a + 1) + (c + 1",30,36,248,507,20.584272861480713

the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and height is 3 cm . find the whole surface of the cylinder ?,"the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and height is 3 cm. find the whole surface of the cylinder?
The radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and the height is 3 cm. To find the whole surface of the cylinder, you can use the formula:

Total Surface Area = 2πr^2 + 2πrh

where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.

In this case, the radius of the cylinder is 7 cm and the height is 3 cm.

Total Surface Area = 2π(7^2) + 2π(3^2) = 2π(49) + 2π(9) = 2π(98) + 2π(81) = 98π + 81π = 2π(99)

Therefore, the whole surface of the cylinder is 99π cm^2.",23,27,120,213,8.206086158752441

There are 50 * 90 = 4500 children in the camp. 90% of them are boys, so there are 4500 * 0.9 = 3600 boys. To make the number of girls 20% of the total number of children, we need to add 3600 * 0.2 = 7200 girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the camp is 4500 + 7200 = 5500. To make the number of girls 20% of the total number of children, we need to subtract 7200 from 5500, which is 7200 - 5500 = 1000.

Let x be the amount of water added to the tank in 1 hour. Then, we can calculate the amount of time it takes to fill the tank by dividing the amount of water added by the rate at which it is added.

For pipe c, we know that it is twice as fast as pipe b, so it will add x/2 water in 1 hour.

For pipe b, we know that it is twice as fast as pipe a, so it will add x/2 water in 1 hour.

For pipe a, we know that it is twice as fast as pipe b, so it will add x/2 water in 1 hour.

Therefore, the total amount of water added in 1 hour is x/2 + x/2 + x/2 = 3x/2.

We can use this to calculate the amount of time it takes to fill the tank.

For pipe c, it will take 1 hour to fill the tank.

For pipe b, it will take 2 hours to fill the tank.

For pipe a, it will take 3 hours to fill the tank.

Therefore, the total time it takes to fill the tank is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 hours.

So, the amount of time it takes to fill the tank is 6 hours.",45,52,255,343,12.899450778961182

circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate . gear l makes 10 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 30 revolutions per minute . how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l ?,"circular gears l and r start to rotate at the same time at the same rate. gear l makes 10 complete revolutions per minute and gear r makes 30 revolutions per minute. how many seconds after the gears start to rotate will gear r have made exactly 6 more revolutions than gear l?
Let's assume that the number of revolutions made by gear l is x. Then, the number of revolutions made by gear r is 6*x. We know that the number of revolutions made by gear r is 30, so we can calculate the number of revolutions made by gear l as follows:

x = 10*r + 30

Now, we can use the fact that the number of revolutions made by gear l is 10*r to simplify the calculation:

x = 10*r + 30 = 10*r + 300

We can then use the fact that the number of revolutions made by gear r is 30 to calculate the number of revolutions made by gear l:

x = 10*r + 30 = 10*r + 300 = 300*r + 300

Now, we can use the fact that the number of revolutions made by gear r is 30 to calculate the number of revolutions made by gear l:

x = 300*r + 300 = 300*r + 900

Therefore, the number of revolutions made by gear r is 900, and the number of revolutions made by gear l is 900 + 6 = 906.",56,66,241,357,12.772862672805786

Let x be the characteristic in the population. Then, the mean of x is m and the standard deviation is d. To find the percent j of the distribution less than m + d, we can use the following formula:

x + (n-1)d = m

where x is the mean of x in the population, n is the sample size, and d is the standard deviation.

To find the percent j of the distribution less than m + d, we can use the following formula:

j = (n-1) * (m + d - x) / (n * d)

where j is the percent of the distribution less than m + d.

To find the percent j of the distribution less than m + d, we can use the following formula:

j = (n-1) * (m + d - x) / (n * d)

"in a lake , there is a patch of lily pads . every day , the patch doubles in size . it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake , how many days would it take the patch to cover half of the lake ?","in a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. every day, the patch doubles in size. it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how many days would it take the patch to cover half of the lake?
The patch doubles in size every day, so it would take 48 days to cover the entire lake. To find the number of days it would take to cover half of the lake, we can use the formula:

x = (n/2) * (n/2)

where x is the number of days, n is the number of lily pads, and (n/2) is the number of lily pads that are half the size of the patch.

To find the number of lily pads in the patch, we can use the formula:

n = (x/2) * (n/2)

where n is the number of lily pads in the patch.

Substituting these formulas into the equation, we get:

n = (x/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) * (n/2) = (x/2) * (n/2) * (n",49,56,228,506,19.727757453918457

x = (z * (1 + 30%) / (1 + 40%)

where (1 + 30%) is the percentage increase in x over 100% and (1 + 40%) is the percentage increase in y over 100%

To find the average marks of all the students in both classes, we need to add the average marks of both classes and divide by the total number of students in both classes. 

For the first class, the average marks are 67 + (58 x 82) = 67 + (58 x 82) = 134 + (134 x 82) = 134 + (134 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (1340 x 82) = 1340 + (",39,46,249,510,20.166919469833374

The compound interest on a sum of $1000 at 10% per annum for 2 years is $631. To find the sum, you can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. In this case, P = $1000, r = 0.1, n = 1, and t = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, A = 1000(1 + 0.1/1)^(1*2) = 1000(1 + 0.1)^2 = 1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 = $1000(1.1)^2 =",29,36,179,510,20.65161156654358

To calculate the rate of simple interest, you can use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. In this case, P = $750, r = 0.1, n = 1, and t = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, A = 750(1 + 0.1/1)^(1*5). A = 750(1.1)^5 = $950. Therefore, the rate of simple interest is 0.1% per year.",20,26,112,188,7.170000076293945

Let's assume the width of the river to be x meters. Then, the distance between the two men on the forward journey is 340 + x meters. Similarly, the distance between the two men on the backward journey is 170 + x meters. Therefore, the width of the river is x + 2x = 2x + 340 = 2x + 340 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 = 2x + 420 ",56,64,273,507,19.381297826766968

Let's say the two numbers are x and y.

To find the difference between them, we can subtract x from y:

x - y = (x - y) + (x - y)

So, for example, if x = 7.5 and y = 12.5, the difference would be:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

7.5 - 12.5 = (7.5 - 12.5) + (7.5 - 12.5)

which is:

To find the number of people enrolled in health maintenance organizations on January 1, 1991, we can use the following formula:

Number of people enrolled in HMOs = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million

Number of people enrolled in HMOs = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million = (1 - 0.15) * 60 million",60,90,235,500,18.284014463424683

jane makes 80 percent more bears per week, so she makes 0.8*80 = $8 more per week.
working 10 percent fewer hours per week, jane works 0.9*80 = $8 less per week.
so, the total output of toy bears per week is $8 + $8 = $16.
the output of toy bears per hour is $8 + $8 = $16.
so, the output of toy bears per hour is $16 + $16 = $32.
the output of toy bears per week is $32 + $32 = $64.
so, the output of toy bears per week is $64 + $64 = $128.
the output of toy bears per hour is $128 + $128 = $256.
so, the output of toy bears per hour is $256 + $256 = $512.
the output of toy bears per week is $512 + $512 = $1024.
so, the output of toy bears per week is $1024 + $1024 = $2048.
the output of toy bears per hour is $2048 + $2048 = $4096.
so, the output of toy bears per hour is $4096 + $4096 = $8192.
the output of toy bears per week is $8192 + $8192 = $16384.
so, the output of toy bears per week is $16384 + $16384 = $32672.
the output of toy bears per hour is $32672 + $32672 = $62944.

"if 0.60 : x : : 6 : 4 , then x is equal to","if 0.60 : x : : 6 : 4, then x is equal to : 3 : 2 : 1
The given condition is 0.60 : x = 6 : 4. To solve this, we can use the order of operations which is PEMDAS or Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. 

In this case, we have to solve the expression 0.60 : x = 6 : 4. 

First, we need to solve the multiplication operation which is 0.60 * 6 = 3.60. 

Then, we have to solve the addition operation which is 3.60 + 4 = 7.60. 

Finally, we have to solve the subtraction operation which is 7.60 - 4 = 3.60.

The distance between the 12th and 20th poles is 20 * (12 + 1) = 220. Therefore, the distance between the 20th and last poles is 220 + 1 = 221. Therefore, the distance between the last and 20th poles is 221 - 20 = 191. Therefore, the distance between the last and 20th poles is 191 * (1 + 1) = 191 * 2 = 382.

for a race a distance of 224 meters can be covered by p in 7 seconds and q in 32 seconds . by what distance does p defeat q eventually ?,"for a race a distance of 224 meters can be covered by p in 7 seconds and q in 32 seconds. by what distance does p defeat q eventually?
Let's assume that the distance covered by p in 7 seconds is x meters. Then, the distance covered by q in 32 seconds is 32 * x meters.

To find the distance covered by p in 7 seconds, we can use the formula:

p = (x - 1) / (2 * 7)

where (x - 1) is the distance covered by q in 32 seconds.

Therefore, p = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - 1) / (2 * 7) = (x - ",31,36,243,510,20.679654598236084

The shopkeeper sells his goods at a cost price of $100. The weight of the faulty meter is 800 grams. To find the profit percent, we need to subtract the cost price from the selling price and divide by the cost price. 

The cost price of the goods is $100. The selling price is $100 + $800 = $1000. 

To find the weight of the faulty meter, we can use the formula weight = mass / gravity. 

The mass of the faulty meter is 800 grams. 

The weight of the faulty meter is 800 / 9.8 = $88.

Let 'w' be the maximum number of integers that can be negative. Then, we can set up the following equation:

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

Now, we can solve for 'w' by adding and subtracting the integers 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f' to get:

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

w = (ab + cdef) - (a + b + c + d + e + f)

To find the time it takes to go 5 km in stationary water, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

Given that the boatman goes 1 km along the current in 20 minutes, we can calculate the speed as:

speed = 1 km / 20 minutes = 0.05 km/min

To find the time it takes to go 5 km in stationary water, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

time = 5 km / 0.05 km/min

time = 100 minutes

Therefore, it will take 100 minutes to go 5 km in stationary water.",38,46,135,199,6.766953229904175

To find the number of shares that can be bought for Rs. 8800, we can use the formula:

Number of shares = Total amount / Share price

In this case, the total amount is Rs. 8800 and the share price is Rs. 20.

Therefore, the number of shares that can be bought for Rs. 8800 is:

Number of shares = Rs. 8800 / Rs. 20 = 40.

To find the sum of the number of combinations possible by using 12 and 34, we can use the formula:

nCr = n! / r!

where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.

In this case, n = 12 and r = 34.

nCr = 12! / 34!
nCr = 12! / (34! * 12!)
nCr = 12! / (2 * 34!)
nCr = 12! / (2 * 34!) = 12! / (2 * 2!) = 12! / 8!

nCr = 12! / 8! = 12! / (2 * 8!) = 12! / 4!

nCr = 12! / 4! = 12! / (2 * 4!) = 12! / 2!

nCr = 12! / 2! = 12! / 1!

nCr = 12! / 1! = 12!

The man cheats by taking 10% more than what he pays for while buying and by giving 20% less than what he claims to sell for while selling. To find the profit percentage, we need to subtract the cost price of the claimed weight from the selling price and divide by the cost price. For example, if the cost price of the claimed weight is $100, the selling price is $120, and the claimed weight is $100, the profit percentage is (120 - 100) / 100 = 10%.",57,67,141,179,5.081371068954468

Let the distance between the two cars be x. Then, the speed of car 1 is 20 m/s and the speed of car 2 is 15 m/s.

To find the time taken by car 2 to reach q, we can use the formula:

t = sqrt(v^2 - (2*a*v)/r)

where v is the speed of the car, a is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and r is the radius of the circle.

For car 1, the distance it travels is 10 seconds * 20 m/s = 200 m.

For car 2, the distance it travels is 10 seconds * 15 m/s = 150 m.

Therefore, the time taken by car 2 to reach q is 10 seconds - 150 seconds = 10 seconds.",56,69,176,271,8.985955476760864

"5 x + y = 19 , and x + 3 y = 1 . find the value of 3 x + 2 y","5 x + y = 19, and x + 3 y = 1. find the value of 3 x + 2 y
To solve this problem, we can use the quadratic formula: 3x + 2y = 1 - 3x - 2y. First, we need to find the value of x. We can do this by solving the equation 3x + 2y = 1 - 3x - 2y. This can be done by factoring the equation, which gives us 3x + 2y = (3x + 2y - 3x - 2y) / 3. We can then simplify this equation to get 3x + 2y = -2y + 3x. This simplifies to 3x + 2y = -2y + 3x = -2y + 3x + 3y = -2y + 3y = -2y + 3. We can then solve for y by subtracting 3 from both sides, giving us y = -2y + 3. Finally, we can substitute this value for y in the equation 3x + 2y = -2y + 3, giving us 3x + 2(-2y) = -2y + 3. We can then solve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides, giving us x = -2y + 3.",24,36,195,361,14.214608430862427

To calculate the cost of painting the outside of a cube, you can use the formula:

Total cost = (Number of sides x Area of each side) + (Number of paint coats x Paint cost per coat)

In this case, the number of sides is 6 (cube has 6 sides), and the area of each side is 6 x 6 = 36 square feet.

The paint cost per coat is $3.20, so the total cost of painting the outside of the cube is:

Total cost = (6 x 6) + (6 x $3.20) = $21.60 + $21.60 = $42.60.

So, it will cost $42.60 to paint the outside of a cube 10 feet on each edge.",34,43,147,230,8.262602806091309

"if p is a prime number greater than 5 , what is the remainder when p ^ 2 is divided by 6 .","if p is a prime number greater than 5, what is the remainder when p ^ 2 is divided by 6.
Let p be a prime number greater than 5. Then, p ^ 2 is equal to p * p = p * (p - 1). We can use the formula for the remainder of a product:

r = (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2

where r is the remainder.

So, if p is a prime number greater than 5, then:

r = (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) / 2

Therefore, the remainder of p ^ 2 divided by 6 is equal to p * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) = p * (p - 1) = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p - 1) / 2 = p * (p - 1) * (p ",23,29,257,510,20.90223264694214

To find the compound interest on $ 46,000 at 20% per annum for 9 months compounded quarterly, you can use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times per year the interest is compounded, and t is the number of months. In this case, P = $ 46,000, r = 0.2, n = 4, and t = 9. Plugging these values into the formula, A = $ 46,000(1 + 0.2)^(4*9) = $ 46,000(1.2)^9 = $ 46,000(1.4)^9 = $ 46,000(1.8)^9 = $ 46,000(2.1)^9 = $ 46,000(2.4)^9 = $ 46,000(2.7)^9 = $ 46,000(2.9)^9 = $ 46,000(3.1)^9 = $ 46,000(3.4)^9 = $ 46,000(3.7)^9 = $ 46,000(3.9)^9 = $ 46,000(4.1)^9 = $ 46,000(4.4)^9 = $ 46,000(4.7)^9 = $ 46,000(4.9)^9 = $ 46,000(5.1)^9 = $ 46,000(5.4)^9 = $ 46,000(5.7)^9 = $ 46,000(5.9)^9 = $ 46,000(6.1)^9 = $ 46,000(6.4)^9 = $ 46,000(6.7)^9 = $ 46,000(6.9)^9 = $ 46,000",18,26,181,511,21.035739183425903

how many pounds of salt at 70 cents / lb must be mixed with 45 lbs of salt that costs 40 cents / lb so that a merchant will get 20 % profit by selling the mixture at 48 cents / lb ?,"how many pounds of salt at 70 cents / lb must be mixed with 45 lbs of salt that costs 40 cents / lb so that a merchant will get 20 % profit by selling the mixture at 48 cents / lb?
To calculate the cost of mixing salt, you can use the formula:

Cost of salt = (Price of salt * Quantity of salt) / 100

In this case, the cost of salt is $0.45 / 100 lbs, so the cost of mixing salt is $0.45 * 45 lbs = $18.45.

To calculate the profit, you can use the formula:

Profit = (Price of salt * Quantity of salt) - (Price of salt * Quantity of salt) / 100

In this case, the price of salt is $0.45 / 100 lbs, so the price of salt is $0.45 * 45 lbs = $18.45.

The cost of mixing salt is $18.45 - $0.45 = $18.00.

The profit is $18.00 - $18.45 = $0.05.

Therefore, the merchant will get a 20% profit by selling the mixture at $0.05 / $0.45.",43,53,179,312,11.315279960632324

So, the total number of days that a, b, and c take to do the work is 10 + 5 + 15 = 30 days.

Now, we can calculate the number of days that c takes to do the work as follows:

So, the total number of days that c takes to do the work is 5 + 15 = 20 days.

Therefore, the total number of days that c takes to do the work is 20 + 5 = 25 days.

To get 70% of the total number of fruits, we need to find the number of oranges that is 70% of 39. This can be done by dividing 70 by 100 and multiplying by 39. So, 70% of 39 is 27. Therefore, to get 70% of 39, we need to remove 27 oranges from the bowl.",33,39,112,151,5.002790212631226

Let the line be represented by the equation (x - 6) + (y + 5) = (m + 2) + (n + p).

To find the value of p, we can use the point-slope form of the line:

Substituting the equation into the point-slope form, we get:

The number of girls in the camp is 90% of 60 = 54. Therefore, the number of boys is 60 - 54 = 6. To make the number of boys 5% of the total number of children, we need to add 6 to the number of boys. So, the number of boys in the camp is 6 + 6 = 12. Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 12 = 9. Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 9 = 8.

Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 28 = 22. Therefore, the number of boys in the camp is 28 + 22 = 50. Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 50 = 45.

Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 176 = 159. Therefore, the number of boys in the camp is 176 + 159 = 435. Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 435 = 382. Therefore, the number of boys in the camp is 435 + 382 = 827. Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is 90% of 827 = 765.

To find Susan's average speed for the entire trip, we can use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Total distance = 40 miles + 20 miles = 60 miles

Total time = 60 miles / 15 miles per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, Susan's average speed for the entire trip was 15 miles per hour.",58,69,115,159,3.9980006217956543

The sides of a triangle are in the ratio 5 : 12 : 13 and its perimeter is 480 m. To find the area, we can use the formula A = (s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))/12, where s is the semiperimeter, a is the area of one side, and c is the perimeter of the triangle. In this case, s = 480, a = 12, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get A = (480(12)(13))/12 = (480*12)(13)/12 = (480*12*13)/12 = (480*13)/12 = (480*12)/12 = (480*12)/6 = (480*6)/6 = (480*6)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 = (480*3)/3 =",25,33,176,510,20.75034523010254

The expression 30 ^ 10 / 180 ^ 5 can be simplified as 30 ^ 5 / 180 ^ 10. To solve for x, we can use the formula x = (a ^ b * c ^ d) / (a ^ c * b ^ d), where a, b, c, and d are the exponents of the numbers in the expression. In this case, a = 30, b = 10, c = 5, and d = 180. Plugging these values into the formula, we get x = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) = (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ 10) / (30 ^ 5 * 180 ^ ",9,17,253,511,21.377925634384155

Therefore, the distance traveled by brad is 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13.33 + 80 = 80 - 13",69,89,256,503,18.315444469451904

The man is standing on a railway bridge which is 180 m long. The train crosses the bridge in 20 seconds, which means it is traveling at a speed of 9 m/s. To find the length of the train, we can use the formula: L = v * t, where L is the length, v is the speed, and t is the time. In this case, the train is traveling at a speed of 9 m/s, and the man is standing on a bridge that is 180 m long. Therefore, the formula becomes: L = 9 * 8 = 72 m.",41,47,139,178,5.845829010009766

Let the first term of the arithmetic progression be x. Then, the last term is 62. To find the number of terms, we can use the formula for an arithmetic progression:

n = (a + l) / 2

where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, l is the last term, and ""a + l"" is the common difference.

In this case, the first term is 2 and the last term is 62. The common difference is 2. Therefore, the formula becomes:

n = (62 + 2) / 2

n = (62 + 2) = 64

There are 64 terms in the arithmetic progression.",28,33,134,199,7.317338943481445

The shopkeeper has 280 kg of apples, which is equivalent to $280. He sells 35% of this at 20% profit, which is $70. Therefore, his total profit is $280 + $70 = $350. To find his percentage profit on the total, we divide the total profit by the total cost and multiply by 100. So, the shopkeeper's percentage profit is $350/$280 * 100% = $125%.",34,48,96,153,4.72240424156189

Let n be the number of different positive prime factors r. Then, n = 14n/60. We can write n as 14n/60 = (14n/60)/(n/60). Since n is a positive integer, we can write n = (n/60). Then, n = (14n/60)/(n/60) = (14n/60)/(n/60) = (n/60)/(n/60). Since n is a positive integer, we can write n = (n/60)/(n/60) = (n/60)/(n/60). Since n is a positive integer, we can write n = (n/60)/(n/60) = (n/60)/(n/60). Since n is a positive integer, we can write n = (n/60)/(n/60) = (n/60)/(n/60).

The weight of liquid x in the solution is 1.5% of 400 + 6.5% of 600 = 1.5% + 6.5% = 8.5%. Therefore, the weight of liquid x in the solution is 8.5% of 400 + 6.5% of 600 = 8.5% + 6.5% = 14.5%.",49,61,120,199,6.194055557250977

The difference in his highest and lowest score is 190 runs. Let's assume his highest score is x and his lowest score is y. Then, his average excluding these two innings would be (x+y)/2 = 58. So, his highest score would be (x+190)/2 = (x+190)/2 = (x+190)/2 = 190.",42,50,88,136,3.9027295112609863

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 0.009

Therefore, the value of x is 0.009.",11,19,41,81,2.7777557373046875
"at the moment there are 54210 tagged birds in a certain wildlife refuge . if exactly 30 percent of all birds in the refuge are tagged , what percent of the untagged birds must be tagged so that half of all birds in the refuge are tagged ?","at the moment there are 54210 tagged birds in a certain wildlife refuge. if exactly 30 percent of all birds in the refuge are tagged, what percent of the untagged birds must be tagged so that half of all birds in the refuge are tagged?
Let x be the number of untagged birds in the refuge. Then, the number of tagged birds is x + (30% of x). To find the number of untagged birds, we can use the formula:

x + (30% of x) = (x + 0.3x) / 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + (0.3x) = (x + 0.3x) / 100

This simplifies to:

x + (0.3x) = (x + 0.3x) / 100

So, we can solve for x by setting x = (0.3x + 0.3x) / 100.

This simplifies to:

x = (0.3x + 0.3x) / 100

So, the number of untagged birds in the refuge is:

x = (0.3x + 0.3x) / 100 = (0.3x + 0.3x) / 100 = 0.3x + 0.3x = 0.6x

Therefore, to tag half of all birds in the refuge, we need to tag 0.6x = 0.3x = 0.2x = 0.1x = 0.1% of all birds in the refuge.",48,56,200,405,15.268480777740479
find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 70 m at the rate of rs . 1 a meter ?,"find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 70 m at the rate of rs. 1 a meter?
To find the cost of fencing around a circular field of diameter 70 m at the rate of Rs. 1 a meter, you can use the formula:

Total cost of fencing = (radius of circle * circumference of circle) / (fence height * number of fence posts)

In this case, the radius of the circle is 70 m, and the circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * 70 m = 1578.8 m. The fence height is 1 meter, and the number of fence posts is 4. Therefore, the total cost of fencing is:

Total cost of fencing = (1578.8 m * 1 m) / (4 fence posts * 1 m) = Rs. 1578.8.",23,27,136,204,7.786795377731323

To find the minimum value of n such that 50! is perfectly divisible by 2520 ^ n, we can use the formula 2520 ^ n = (2 * 2520 ^ (n-1)). We can simplify this formula by using the formula 2520 ^ (n-1) = (2 * 2520 ^ (n-2)).

Yes, it is possible to distribute the maximum number of pens and pencils in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and pencils. The maximum number of pens and pencils that can be distributed is 1340 and 1280 respectively. Therefore, the maximum number of pens and pencils that can be distributed is 1340 + 1280 = 2680. If we distribute 2680 pens and pencils, each student will get 2680 / 1340 = 2 pens and 2680 / 1280 = 2 pencils.

Let's assume that the work done by Mahesh in 20 days is x. Then, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+30). So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+30). Now, we can use the formula x+30=x+90. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+90). Now, we can use the formula x+90=x+180. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+180). Now, we can use the formula x+180=x+360. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+360). Now, we can use the formula x+360=x+720. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+720). Now, we can use the formula x+720=x+1440. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+1440). Now, we can use the formula x+1440=x+3600. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+3600). Now, we can use the formula x+3600=x+7200. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+7200). Now, we can use the formula x+7200=x+36000. So, the work done by Rajesh in 30 days is (x+36000). Now, we can use the formula x+36000=x+720000.

Let's call the total amount of nuts in the combined mixture 'n'. Then, the total amount of dried fruit in the combined mixture is 'd'. The total amount of the mixture is'm'. 

To find the percentage of the mixture that is nuts, we can use the formula: 

n = (m - d)/n 

where n is the percentage of the mixture that is nuts. 

To find the percentage of the mixture that is dried fruit, we can use the formula: 

d = (n - m)/d 

where d is the percentage of the mixture that is dried fruit. 

Substituting the values from the problem, we have: 

n = (m - d)/n = (48 - 30)/48 = 0.8 

d = (n - m)/d = (0.8 - 0.4)/0.8 = 0.4

Let's assume that the wages earned by robin is x. Then, the wages earned by charles is 1.5x. So, the wages earned by charles is 1.5x + 1.5x = 3x. Therefore, the wages earned by charles is 3x - 1.5x = 1.5x + 1.5x = 1.5x + 3x = 4x. So, the wages earned by charles is 4x - 1.5x = 1.5x + 1.5x = 1.5x + 2.5x = 4x + 1.5x = 5x. Therefore, the wages earned by charles is 5x - 1.5x = 1.5x + 1.5x = 1.5x + 2.5x = 5x + 1.5x = 6.5x.

Let x = 4. Then, x^2 = 16 and x^4 = 256.

For x^4 + 1/x^4, we can use the formula:

x^4 + 1/x^4 = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 1)

We can simplify this formula as:

x^4 + 1/x^4 = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 1) = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 1 + 1) = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 2)

We can simplify this further as:

x^4 + 1/x^4 = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 2) = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 2 + 1) = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 3)

We can simplify this further as:

x^4 + 1/x^4 = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 2 + 1) = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 3) = (x^2 + 1)/(x^2 + 6)

To calculate the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 600 per sq. metre, you can use the formula:

Cost of slabs = (Length x Width x Thickness) / (Area of slabs x Thickness)

In this case, the length of the room is 5.5 m and the width is 3.75 m. The thickness of the slabs is 0.375 m.

So, the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 600 per sq. metre would be:

Cost of slabs = (5.5 m x 3.75 m x 0.375 m) / (600 x 0.375 m) = Rs. 2,500

Therefore, the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 600 per sq. metre would be Rs. 2,500.",35,46,157,244,9.157072305679321

Let's call the total amount of nuts in the combined mixture 'n'. Then, the total amount of dried fruit in the combined mixture is 'd'. The total amount of the mixture is 'x'. We know that 'x' is 35 % of the combined mixture, so we can set up the equation: 'n + (x/100) = 35'. Solving for 'n', we get 'n = 0.35'. Therefore, the total amount of nuts in the combined mixture is 0.35 x 'n'. The total amount of dried fruit in the combined mixture is 0.65 x 'n'. So, the total amount of the mixture is 0.35 x 'n' + 0.65 x 'n'. Simplifying this equation, we get 'n + (n/100) = 0.65'. Solving for 'n', we get 'n = 0.65'. Therefore, the total amount of the mixture is 0.65 x 'n'.",57,77,183,308,10.360705852508545

To calculate the gain percentage, first find the marked price by multiplying the cost price by 100. Then, subtract the marked price from the cost price to find the discount percentage. Finally, divide the discount percentage by 100 to find the gain percentage. In this case, the marked price is 100 + 70 = 170, the cost price is 170 * 0.7 = $127, and the discount percentage is 10 * 0.9 = $9. Therefore, the gain percentage is 9 - 70 = -61%.",26,32,108,155,5.492311954498291

There are 48 apples and 30 kiwis in the box. To find the number of kiwis that must be added to the box, we can use the formula: (n/100) * (a+b) = 30. In this case, n = 48, a = 48, and b = 30. Plugging these values into the formula, we get (48/100) * (48+30) = 30. So, to find the number of kiwis that must be added to the box, we can simply subtract the number of kiwis from the total number of apples: 48 - 30 = 18. Therefore, to make 30% of the pieces of fruit in the box apples, we need to add 18 kiwis to the box.",40,50,152,233,8.047770738601685

To find the value of 2 standard deviations less than the mean, you can use the following formula:

2 * StandardDeviation - Mean = 2 * StandardDeviation - Mean + 1

In this case, the mean is 17.5 and the standard deviation is 2.5. So, the value of 2 standard deviations less than the mean is:

2 * 2.5 - 17.5 = -1.5

The simple interest on a certain sum of money at the rate of 5% per annum for 8 years is Rs. 840. To calculate the simple interest on the same amount of money after 5 years, you can use the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest per annum, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years. In this case, P = Rs. 100, r = 0.05, n = 1, and t = 8. Plugging these values into the formula, A = 100(1 + 0.05)^(1*8) = 100(1.05)^8 = Rs. 840.",48,59,160,240,8.104214191436768

To find the ratio of 20% methyl alcohol to 50% methyl alcohol, we can use the formula:

Methyl alcohol (CH3OH) is a polar molecule, which means that it has a partial positive charge on the oxygen atom and a partial negative charge on the hydrogen atoms. This means that the two solutions will mix together to form a solution that has a higher concentration of methyl alcohol than the 20% solution.

This means that the two solutions will mix together to form a solution that has a higher concentration of methyl alcohol than the 50% solution.

Therefore, to mix the two solutions together, we need to use a ratio of 20% methyl alcohol to 50% methyl alcohol. This means that we need to mix 0.2 liters of 20% methyl alcohol with 0.8 liters of 50% methyl alcohol to form a solution that has a concentration of 40% methyl alcohol.",32,39,226,296,11.25360631942749

Let the line be represented by the equation `y = 8x + 5`. Then, the equation of the line passing through points (m,n) and (m+2,n+p) is `y = 8(n+p) + 5`. We can solve for `n+p` by subtracting `n` from both sides and then adding `5`. This gives us `n+p = 8(n+p) + 5`. We can then solve for `n` by dividing both sides by `8`. This gives us `n = 5`.

To calculate the cost of paying the floor by slabs at the rate of Rs. 900 per sq. metre, you can use the formula:

Cost of slabs = (Length x Width x Thickness) / (Area of slabs x Thickness)

In this case, the length of the room is 8 m, width is 4.75 m, and thickness is 0.375 m.

So, the cost of paying the floor by slabs would be:

Cost of slabs = (8 x 4.75 x 0.375) / (4.75 x 0.375) = Rs. 3,750.

Let the ages of the captain and wicket keeper be x and 11 respectively. Then, the ages of the remaining 11 members are 11-x. The average age of the remaining members is (11+11)/2 = 11.5. Therefore, the average age of the team is 11.5 years.",60,68,101,135,3.136098861694336
"the area of one square is x ^ 2 + 12 x + 36 and the area of another square is 4 x ^ 2 − 12 x + 9 . if the sum of the perimeters of both squares is 64 , what is the value of x ?","the area of one square is x ^ 2 + 12 x + 36 and the area of another square is 4 x ^ 2 − 12 x + 9. if the sum of the perimeters of both squares is 64, what is the value of x?
The sum of the perimeters of both squares is 64. Therefore, the area of one square is 4 x ^ 2 - 12 x + 36 and the area of the other square is 4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9. Since the sum of the perimeters of both squares is 64, we can write the area of one square as 4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 36 and the area of the other square as 4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9. To find the value of x, we can use the formula x = 4 + sqrt(4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 36) = 4 + sqrt(4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9). Simplifying this equation, we get x = 4 + sqrt(4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9) = 4 + sqrt(4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9) = 4 + sqrt(4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9) = 4 + sqrt(4 x ^ 2 + 12 x + 9) = 4 + 3 = 7.

Let's assume that the size of the files uploaded by server g is x and the size of the files uploaded by server y is y. Then, the total size of the files uploaded by the two servers is x + y. 

If server g uploads 480 files in 4 hours, then the rate of uploading is 1/4 = 0.25. Similarly, if server y uploads 480 files in 8 hours, then the rate of uploading is 1/8 = 0.125. 

Therefore, the total time taken by the two servers to upload 480 files is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 hours. 

If the two servers are working at their respective constant rates, then the time taken by server g to upload 480 files is 0.25 * 4 = 1 hour. Similarly, the time taken by server y to upload 480 files is 0.125 * 8 = 0.5 hours.

To calculate the cost of paving the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 800 per sq. metre, you can use the formula:

Cost of paving = (Length x Width x Rate per sq. metre) / 100

In this case, the length of the room is 5.5 m and the width is 3.75 m. The rate per sq. metre is 800 rs per sq. metre.

Therefore, the cost of paving the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 800 per sq. metre would be:

Cost of paving = (5.5 x 3.75 x 800) / 100

The cost of paving the floor by slabs at the rate of rs. 800 per sq. metre would be:

Cost of paving = (5.5 x 3.75 x 800) / 100

The new speed limit is 35 miles per hour, which is 10 miles per hour less than the old speed limit of 55 miles per hour. To find out how many minutes it will take to travel along this section of highway at the new speed limit, you can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

where ""distance"" is the total distance traveled, ""speed"" is the new speed limit, and ""time"" is the duration of the journey.

To find out how many minutes it will take to travel along this section of highway at the new speed limit, you can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

where ""time"" is the duration of the journey and ""distance"" is the total distance traveled.

Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to travel along this section of highway at the new speed limit, you can use the formula:

time = (35 miles per hour / 10 miles per hour) = 3.5 minutes

So, it will take approximately 3.5 minutes more to travel along this section of highway at the new speed limit than it would have taken at the old speed limit.",59,66,251,324,11.319943904876709

The person borrows 7000 for 3 years at 6% simple interest. He immediately lends it to another person at 31% simple interest for 3 years. To find his gain in the transaction per year, we can use the formula:

Gain = Principal x (1 + Interest Rate) / (1 + Interest Rate)^(1 + Number of Years)

In this case, the Principal is 7000, the Interest Rate is 6%, and the Number of Years is 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Gain = 7000 x (1 + 0.06)^(1 + 3)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Gain = 7000 x (1.06)^3

The result of this calculation is 7150. Therefore, the person's gain in the transaction per year is $7150.",44,60,157,261,9.045763969421387

So, current population = 1000

population = 1000 * (1 + 0.1) = 1000 * 1.1 = 1100

To find the number of years it takes for the population to double, we can use the formula:

population = current population * (1 + growth rate)

where growth rate is 10%.

So, current population = 1000

population = 1000 * (1 + 0.1) = 1000 * 1.1 = 1100

To find the number of years it takes for the population to double, we can use the formula:

Let the number of red candies be x. Then, the number of green candies is x/2, the number of orange candies is x/4, the number of yellow candies is x/8, and the number of blue candies is x/16.

Kaz eats all the green candies, which is x/2. Then, he eats half of the remaining orange candies, which is x/4. Finally, he eats half of the remaining yellow candies, which is x/8.

Therefore, the number of remaining red candies is x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16)/2 = (x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x",82,96,253,501,18.074252367019653

To find the actual cost of an article, you can use the following formula:

Actual cost = (decreased price x original price) / 100

In this case, the decreased price is 24 % of the original price, so the formula would be:

Actual cost = (24 * 100) / 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Actual cost = 2400 / 100

Amar takes 12 meters in 1 second, so it takes 12 seconds to cover 12 meters. The car takes 45 meters in 1 second, so it takes 45 seconds to cover 45 meters. Therefore, the distance covered by Amar in 1.4 km is (1.4 km - 45 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1.4 km - 180 m) = (1",35,42,251,510,20.330881595611572

Let's assume that Nick has completed (n-1) laps around the track per hour. Then, Nick has completed (n-1) laps around the track per hour, and Marla has completed (n-1) laps around the track per hour. Therefore, Marla has completed (n-1) + (n-1) = (n-1) + 2 laps around the track per hour. Therefore, Marla has completed (n-1) + (n-1) = (n-1) + 2 = (n-1) + 2 + 1 = (n-1) + 3 laps around the track per hour. Therefore, Marla has completed (n-1) + (n-1) + 3 = (n-1) + 4 laps around the track per hour. Therefore, Marla has completed (n-1) + 4 = (n-1) + 4 + 1 = (n-1) + 5 laps around the track per hour.

Therefore, Marla has completed (n-1) + 7 = (n-1) + 7 + 1 = (n-1) + 8 laps around the track per hour. Therefore, Marla has completed (n-1) + 8 = (n-1) + 8 ",62,72,260,509,19.048540353775024

Let the work done by a in 11 days be x. Then, the work done by band c in 45 days is 45x. Similarly, the work done by band c in 55 days is 55x.

Now, let the work done by a in 11 days be x. Then, the work done by band c in 11 days is 11x.

Therefore, the work done by a in 11 days is 11x + 45x + 55x = 11x + 220x.

The cost of peanuts is $ 1.50 per pound, so the cost of cashews is $ 7.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost of mixed nuts is $ 1.50 + $ 7.00 = $ 8.50 per pound. To sell 100 pounds of mixed nuts, the wholesaler must mix 100 pounds of peanuts with 100 pounds of cashews. Since the cost of peanuts is $ 1.50 per pound, the cost of cashews is $ 7.00 per pound, and the cost of mixed nuts is $ 8.50 per pound, the total cost is $ 100.00 per pound.

"when positive integer n is divided by 5 , the remainder is 1 . when n is divided by 7 , the remainder is 3 . what is the smallest positive integer k such that k + n is a multiple of 39 ?","when positive integer n is divided by 5, the remainder is 1. when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 3. what is the smallest positive integer k such that k + n is a multiple of 39?
Let n be the smallest positive integer such that n + 39 is a multiple of 39. Then, n + 39 = 39 * n + 39. We can solve for n by adding 39 to the remainder of n divided by 5. This gives us:

n + 39 = 39 * n + 39
n + 39 = 39 * (n + 39) + 39
n + 39 = 39 * n + 39 + 39

Let's assume that the distance covered by p in 14 seconds is x meters. Then, the distance covered by q in 32 seconds is 32 * x meters.

To find the distance covered by p in 14 seconds, we can use the formula:

p = (x - 1) / (2 * 32)

where (x - 1) is the distance covered by q in 32 seconds.

Therefore, p = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - 1) / (2 * 32) = (x - ",31,36,243,510,20.63118600845337

the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and height is 6 cm . find the whole surface of the cylinder ?,"the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and height is 6 cm. find the whole surface of the cylinder?
The radius of a cylindrical vessel is 7 cm and the height is 6 cm. To find the whole surface of the cylinder, you can use the formula:

Total Surface Area = 2πr^2 + 2πrh

where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.

In this case, the radius of the cylinder is 7 cm and the height is 6 cm.

Total Surface Area = 2π(7^2) + 2π(6^2) = 2π(49) + 2π(36) = 2π(84) + 2π(36) = 2π(84) + 2π(36) = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π + 36π = 84π +",23,27,235,510,20.99172306060791

Let's assume that Sushil's marks in science are x. Then, his marks in English and Maths are 170 and 170/4, respectively.

To find Sushil's marks in science, we can use the following formula:

Sushil's marks in science = (x/4 + 170)/3

Substituting the given values, we get:

Sushil's marks in science = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (x/4 + 170)/3 = (",45,57,201,507,19.691537141799927

"if xerox paper costs 5 cents a sheet and a buyer gets 10 % discount on all xerox paper one buys after the first 2000 papers and 20 % discount after first 10000 papers , how much will it cost to buy 20000 sheets of xerox paper ?","if xerox paper costs 5 cents a sheet and a buyer gets 10 % discount on all xerox paper one buys after the first 2000 papers and 20 % discount after first 10000 papers, how much will it cost to buy 20000 sheets of xerox paper?
To calculate the cost of 20000 sheets of xerox paper, you can use the following formula:

Cost = (xerox paper cost per sheet * xerox paper cost per sheet) / (discount * xerox paper cost per sheet)

Where xerox paper cost per sheet is 5 cents and the discount is 20%.

So, the cost of 20000 sheets of xerox paper would be:

Cost = (5 cents per sheet * 20000 sheets) / (20% discount) = $20000

Therefore, it would cost $20000 to buy 20000 sheets of xerox paper.",48,67,134,222,6.855170726776123

To find the time it takes to go 5 km in stationary water, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

Given that the boatman goes 1 km in 10 minutes, we can calculate the speed as:

speed = 1 km / 10 minutes = 0.1 km/min

To find the time it takes to go 5 km, we can use the formula:

time = 5 km / 0.1 km/min = 500 minutes

In this case, P = 6000, r = 0.04, n = 1, and t = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get A = 6000(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*2) = 6000(1.04)^2 = 6000 * 1.124 = 7240.

Therefore, the amount on Rs. 6000 in 2 years, assuming a rate of interest of 4% per year, would be Rs. 7240.",29,39,139,243,9.00640606880188

"if x and y are both odd prime numbers and x < y , how many distinct positive integer factors does 2 xy have ?","if x and y are both odd prime numbers and x < y, how many distinct positive integer factors does 2 xy have?
Let x and y be odd prime numbers. Then, x and y are both odd and are therefore relatively prime. This means that x and y are relatively prime to each other. Therefore, x and y are both odd and are relatively prime to each other.

To find the number of distinct positive integer factors that 2 xy has, we can use the formula x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y).

Let x = 2 and y = 1. Then, x^2 = 4 and y^2 = 1.

We can use the formula x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) to calculate the number of distinct positive integer factors that 2 xy has.

The formula is x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = (x - y)(x + y + 1) = (x - y)(x + y + 2) = (x - y)(x + y + 3) = (x - y)(x + y + 4) = (x - y)(x + y + 5) = (x - y)(x + y + 6) = (x - y)(x + y + 7) = (x - y)(x + y + 8) = (x - y)(x + y + 9) = (x - y)(x + y + 10) = (x - y)(x + y + 11) = (x - y)(x + y + 12) = (x - y)(x + y + 13) = (x - y)(x + y + 14) = (x - y)(x + y + 15) = (x - y)(",25,30,275,510,20.82590889930725

There are 80 apples and 30 oranges in the box. To find the number of oranges that must be added to the box to make 50% of the fruit pieces be apples, we can use the formula: (n/2) * (a+b) = 50%, where n is the number of pieces of fruit, a is the number of apples, and b is the number of oranges. In this case, we have 80 + 30 = 110 pieces of fruit. So, we can use the formula: (n/2) * (a+b) = 50%. If we substitute n = 110, a = 80, and b = 30, we get (n/2) * (a+b) = 50%.

Let x be the number of digits in the number 9. Then, 9 ^ x = 3 ^ 16. We can solve for x by using the formula x = (9 ^ (x + 1)) / (9 ^ x - 1). This gives us x = (9 ^ (x + 1)) / (9 ^ (x + 1 - 1)). We can simplify this to x = (9 ^ (x + 1)) / (9 ^ (x + 1 - 1)).

the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 5 cm and height is 3 cm . find the whole surface of the cylinder ?,"the radius of a cylindrical vessel is 5 cm and height is 3 cm. find the whole surface of the cylinder?
The radius of a cylindrical vessel is 5 cm and the height is 3 cm. To find the whole surface of the cylinder, you can use the formula:

Total Surface Area = 2πr^2 + 2πrh

where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.

In this case, the radius of the cylinder is 5 cm and the height is 3 cm.

Total Surface Area = 2π(5^2) + 2π(3^2) = 2π(25) + 2π(9) = 2π(34) = 34π cm^2

There are 200 questions in a 3 hour examination. Out of these 200 questions, 15 are type A problems which require twice as much time as type B problems. Therefore, there are 30 type A problems in the 3 hour examination. If we assume that each type A problem takes 10 minutes to solve, then we can calculate the time spent on type A problems as follows:

Total time spent on type A problems = 30 x 10 = 300 minutes.

Total time spent on type B problems = 200 x 10 = 20000 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 30000 - 20000 = 10000 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 10000 / 10 = 1000 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 1000 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 1000 / 60 = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

Therefore, the time spent on type A problems = 16.67 minutes.

The number of candidates appeared in state a is 6 % of 100 = 6.

Let x be the number of valid votes received by b. Then, the number of valid votes received by a is (x + 15 % of 8720). We can solve for x by subtracting 15 % of 8720 from 8720 and then adding 15 % of 8720. This gives us x = (8720 + 15 * 8720) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500) = (8720 + 13500)",61,74,230,508,18.97010064125061

"on a ranch , a rancher can place a loop of rope , called a lasso , once in every 2 throws around a cow ’ s neck . what is the probability that the rancher will be able to place a lasso around a cow ’ s neck at least once in 4 attempts ?","on a ranch, a rancher can place a loop of rope, called a lasso, once in every 2 throws around a cow ’ s neck. what is the probability that the rancher will be able to place a lasso around a cow ’ s neck at least once in 4 attempts?
The probability of placing a lasso around a cow's neck at least once in 4 attempts is 0.25. This is because the rancher has a 50% chance of success in each attempt, so the probability of success is 0.5. To find the number of times the rancher will be able to place a lasso around a cow's neck, we can use the formula: P(success) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)). In this case, P(success) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)). So, P(success) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * (1 +... + 1)) = (1/2) * (1 + (1/2) * ",56,69,227,498,19.174911499023438

Let x and y be two positive integers such that x > 1 and y > 1, and x + 3y < 902. Then, the length of x is x + 3y - 1, and the length of y is x + 3y - 1. We can use the formula x + 3y = (x + 3y - 1) + 1 to calculate the length of x and y. Let x = 2, y = 3, and x + 3y = (2 + 3) = 5. Then, x + 3y = 5 + 3 = 8. Similarly, let x = 3, y = 2, and x + 3y = (3 + 2) = 5. Then, x + 3y = 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the length of x and the length of y is 8.",105,138,234,369,10.62317180633545

Let x be the number of two - bedroom apartments in the building. Then, the average rental price for all two - bedroom apartments is $ 8,400. Therefore, the average rental price for all apartments in the building is $ 8,400 + $ 2,800 = $ 10,800. Since the average rental price for all apartments in the building is $ 10,800, then the number of two - bedroom apartments in the building is $ 10,800 / $ 8,400 = 1.25.

To find the time it takes for car a to overtake and drive 8 miles ahead of car b, we can use the formula:

t = (d/v) / (b/v)

where t is the time, d is the distance, and v is the speed.

In this case, the distance between the two cars is 8 miles, and the speed of each car is 50 miles per hour.

t = (8/50) = 1.6 hours

Therefore, it will take 1.6 hours for car a to overtake and drive 8 miles ahead of car b.",71,80,158,219,6.250091791152954

Let the length of the rectangle be x. Then, the excess length is 14% of x and the deficit length is 5% of x. The area of the rectangle is (x + 5) * 14% + (x - 14%) * 5%. The error percentage in the area can be calculated as follows:

Error percentage = (x + 5) * 14% + (x - 14%) * 5% - (x + 5) * 14% + (x - 14%) * 5%

The error percentage is (x + 5) * 14% + (x - 14%) * 5% - (x + 5) * 14% + (x - 14%) * 5%

Simplifying the expression, we get:

To find the rate percent, you can use the formula: (100 * (1 + rate / 100)) - 100. In this case, the rate is 100% (1 + 100% = 100%), so the formula becomes: (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100. Simplifying this equation, we get: (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% / 100)) - 100 = (100 * (1 + 100% /",32,44,231,506,20.258350133895874

Let's assume that Peter's age is x. Then, Peter's age is twice as old as Paul's age when Peter was as old as Paul is now. So, Peter's age is 2x.

Now, let's assume that Paul's age is y. Then, Paul's age is twice as old as Peter's age when Paul was as old as Peter is now. So, Paul's age is 2x.

Now, let's add the ages of Peter and Paul.

Peter's age is 2x + y.

Paul's age is 2x + y.
